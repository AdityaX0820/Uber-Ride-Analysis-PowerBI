# Uber Ride Analysis PowerBI

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on Uber ride data, leveraging Microsoft PowerBI for interactive visualization and business insights.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze patterns, trends, and key metrics related to Uber rides. Using PowerBI, we transform raw ride data into meaningful dashboards and reports that help uncover insights for business intelligence, operational improvements, and strategic decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Raw Uber ride data is cleaned, transformed, and loaded into PowerBI for analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Visualizations include ride frequency, revenue analysis, time-based trends, geographical heatmaps, and customer segmentation.
- **Key Metrics:** Track metrics such as total rides, revenue, average trip duration, peak hours, and popular locations.
- **Business Insights:** Identify growth opportunities, operational bottlenecks, and customer behavior patterns.
