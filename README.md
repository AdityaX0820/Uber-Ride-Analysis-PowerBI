# Uber-Ride-Analysis-PowerBI
This project involves an in-depth analysis of over 600,000 Uber ride records. It features an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize bookings, revenue, and trip efficiency. A time-series forecasting model using Python's Prophet library was trained to predict ride demand patterns and integrated into the dashboard.
